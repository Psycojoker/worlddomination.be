Internet drama is a tragically quite common situation blablabla.

This situation is especially unproductive and useless since most of the time no
one will took action, everyone will lost their energy (and therefor motivation)
and the atmosphere will suffer of it. Therefor you should avoid those
situations like poison.

### How to recognize Internet drama?

Well, there isn't a perfect definition of an Internet drama, but it is quite
easy to recognize it since a lot of common patterns occurs. Here is an
unordered non exhaustive list of hint to detect it:

* critical actors are missing
* those missing actors are often accused on rarely concrete base (and this nearly never match the reality)
* participants lacks of informations ("Oh yeah, I've only read of part of <this important piece of information>")
* the conversation is emotional (can very in intensity)
* the arguments are emotional (can very in intensity)
* the arguments are personal opinion rarely rational
* people are arguing on the form, not the content
* no new or very few rational arguments are created during the drama and most of the existing one are just retold again and again in just a different way (this create a nice while true loop)
* old members of the association/group just state their opinion on how this should be done (and sometime how they were doing this at their time)
* in a more general way participants just don't know what there are talking about but just want to express their opinion
* no one is acting in a proactive manner to tack actions or unblock the situation
* people don't read/listen to each others correctly
* personal attacks occurs

In summary, if your are in an (highly) emotional interaction without critical
actors and/or lack of informations where nothing concrete is generated just
leave it or stop it if you can, nothing good will came out of it.

Unsurprisingly, the cause of those situation are often emotional or a lack of
communication. Both can be solved pretty easily but this as to be done the more
earlier possible (since the participants nearly never won't do it).

### But wait, Internet drama is also occurring in real life!

Sadly yes, this is a very common situation in every groups, Internet just
empathise it (and I love the term "Internet drama").
