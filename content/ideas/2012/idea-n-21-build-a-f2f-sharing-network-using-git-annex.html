#### Why

I often want to share small files/documents/others with friends.

#### Problem

Currents solutions kinda sucks for this, we have:

* bitorrent/other p2p network: overkill, complex to use, need all the time running software
* central ftp: sucks, centralized, need lot of place, a public server with good bandwidth, access management sucks
* ftp at everyone place: complex to manage, to take care about, access management also sucks

#### Idea

##### Git annex

Normally, to share a common git repository with all the files would be a very
stupid and inefficient idea. Luckily, [someone](http://joeyh.name/) out there has created a
wonderful tool call [git annex](http://git-annex.branchable.com/).

Git annex is an extension for git that which purpose is to manage "media-like" files.
The big concept is that instead of storing the said files in git, you store
references to those files (symlinks) and git annex handle those files for you.
This way, the size of your repository isn't going to totally exploded over
time.

A common usage scenario looks like this (without the details):

* create a git repository
* tell git annex to add those big files to the repository
* somewhere else, clone this repository <b>this will only pull the references to those files, no the actual files</b>
* now, ask git annex, on the other repository, to get either some or all the files that are referenced <- <b>this is the important part</b> (you obviously need to be able to access this other repository)

##### Usage

So, the idea is to have one common central repository where everyone can push
and that contains all the references. This way, everyone knows what is
available, the sever doesn't have to store that much, you don't have to store
everything and when you want to get a file, git annex will pull it directly
from your friend's place.

Or, you can simply removed the central component and just share git
repositories between your friends.

Advantages:

* can be done right now without coding needed
* easy to use (for nerd)
* very flexible, you can adapt to [alot](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_D_Z-D2tzi14/S8TRIo4br3I/AAAAAAAACv4/Zh7_GcMlRKo/s1600/ALOT.png) of different situations (this is git)
* you can easily plug an external server with good bandwidth to host big files
* you store only what you want and where you want
* no central place needed
* git annex is available in every common *nix distributions and probably even on the other OS of shame
* no (software) server needed!
* you can do access control very easily with ssh keys and all those stuff, that problem is already solved long time ago for git usage
* you'll feel very leet using this
* easily scriptable
* encrypted communications very easy to add (git can talk other ssh)
* and many more!

Disadvantages:

* your friends need to be nerd
* your friends need to know at least a bit of git
* your friends need to have a server up if you want to get their files (except if the file is at another place)
* not very easy to share files between different circle of friends, this only scale well for one circle
* downloading/upload won't be split amongs several peers to accelerate the transfer
* this will work well for small files, for big files this might be too slow, but this can be solved by plugging a server with good bandwidth in the middle
* you are still fucked up by NAT
* I don't know if this will be pleasant to use

#### Going further

It's not very hard to imagine expending this concept because we always need an
excuse to code and learn new things.

I don't think this would be very hard to build a series of scripts to eases the
usage of this tool, libs for git already exist in several languages.

Things that can be done:

* a nice interface (web/desktop/ncurse/whatever) that display useful informations like what files are present, from where you can pull other files
* use libinotify/incrontab to automagically detect files modifications in the repository and automagically do a "git annex sync" (git pull/push from every repositories)
* hack git internals to add metadata to files
* build an abstraction layer/automagic tool to handle permissions
* notification system to inform you that new files are available via emails/whatever
* automatically organize the repository/files for you and remove you the burn of sorting/classing things
* find a way to solve the NAT problem
* and, of course, many more!

Remark: the "git annex sync" part might be problematic for permissions reasons.
