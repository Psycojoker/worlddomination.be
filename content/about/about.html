## [Neutrinet](http://neutrinet.be)

I'm part of Neutrinet, a project to build an associative, non-profit,
volunteer-based ISP in Belgium (more or less starting by Brussels) where I help
in the general organisation, promotion and administrative part.

I've co-initiated the project and relaunched it in July of this year to change
its type of organisation into a do-ocracy. We are a small, friendly team and are
making good progress but the road is very long. Don't hesitate to join us, we
meet every second Thursday at the [123 rue Royale](http://www.123rueroyale.be/)
around 19h30, you can find more informations on our [wonderful
website](http://neutrinet.be) (I'm guilty of it).

Since its relaunch, the project has made great progress:

* we have a hosting on [LDN](http://ldn-fai.net) server in strasbourg
* we have our ip range (v4 and v6)
* great new people have joined us
* we have a "net neutralizor" VPN offer that gave you a public static ip address
* we have our first paying members (11 currently, this will move to 28 very soon)
* we are about to get our own physical server (in Rotterdam probably)
* we start to get some visibly (I've been to the radio several time to talk about Neutrinet and related project)
* but most importantly, we have initiated and are very involved in the Internet Cube project (see bellow)

Neutrinet is member of [Gitoyen](http://www.gitoyen.net/) and of
[FFDN](http://ffdn.org).

## [Internet Cube](http://internetcu.be)

The Internet Cube is an [FFDN](http://ffdn.org) project launched by
[Neutrinet](http://neutrinet.be), [LDN](http://ldn-fai.net) and
[YUNOHOST](http://yunohost.org).

## [NURPA](http://nurpa.be)

NURPA is a citizen group that defend our Fundamental Freedom of the Internet.
We are active in the Belgium level and the European level.

I'm a co-founder and I'm involved in the technical and networking (with humans)
level.

## [Baron](https://github.com/Psycojoker/baron)

Baron is a project to build a *lossless AST* (abstract syntactic tree) for
Python, the building block to easy write refactoring, code generation and code
inspection tools for Python. A more detailed explanation can be found
[here](/blog/2013/the-baron-project-part-1-what-and-why.html).

The project is moving well and I'm already able to parse a not so small subset
of python, but, considering the size of the task, I still have a lot to do.

## [UrLab](http://urlab.be)

UrLab is (mostly) a student Hackerspace located in the ULB (Free University of
Brussels). We organise a lot of conferences and workshops and try to focus on
knowledge sharing, openness and a friendly and open atmosphere.

I'm not as present at it as I used to be but I've made (and continue to do)
several talks and workshop at it, including (but not only):

<div style="text-align: left; width: 70%;">

<ul>
<li>a <a href="http://docs.saltstack.com/index.html">salt</a> introduction workshop, <a href="http://psycojoker.github.io/salt_workshop_slides/">slides</a></li>
<li>a presentation of <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell">haskell</a> and <a href="http://www.erlang.org/">erlang</a> <a href="https://github.com/Psycojoker/slides_haskell_or_erlang">slides</a></li>
<li>an introduction to <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/">Django</a> where I live coded a very simple blog</li>
<li>I've also made an introduction workshop to Django</li>
<li>a return of experience on using <a href="http://www.zabbix.com/">Zabbix</a> at work</li>
</ul>

</div>

I also really enjoy finding people to do talks at UrLab. Most of the people do
interesting things but won't spontaneously do a talk about it. This is also a
great occasion to build bridges between communities.

I'm part of the co-initiators but this project is really a collective
realisation and I'm proud of it.

## [❤ Belgium Hacker Agenda ❤](http://hackeragenda.urlab.be/)

The ❤* Belgium Hacker Agenda *❤ started as a one weekend project on "how could
I help the members of a community that I love to know and interact more"
(namely, the hackerspaces community of Belgium). My answer has been to scrap
the events of every hackerspace/similar organisation of Belgium (yes, scrap,
except one, no one is offering a .ics ..) and centralise it in one website so that
everyone can be informed of what everyone else is doing.

Since this one weekend, the project has evolved quite a lot: filter has been
added, sections too, events are displayed on a map when I found their location
(using Nominatim of OpenStreetMap), events are posted [on
twitter](https://twitter.com/hackeragenda_be), and admin interface is there for
the case an organisation doesn't have the event on their website. There are
prototype or reusing it for France, Vegetarian/vegan event in French speaking
Belgium and for the ULB. I also have received from [regular to punctal
help](https://github.com/Psycojoker/hackeragenda/graphs/contributors) from
[UrLab](http://urlab.be) community.

According to the feedback I randomly get from people or the community, it
appears this project is actually quite useful to them. People have told me that
they've discovered and joined some group using it.

According to nginx logs, there is something between 60 and 100 unique ip per
days visiting the website. The Belgium instance currently have 75 sources of
events.

This project has also been the occasion for one of [my first
script](https://github.com/Psycojoker/hackeragenda/blob/40ac0c75b820476be934b71877243cd65d4e3afe/add_meetup.py)
(as opposed to interactive session) with
[RedBaron](https://github.com/psycojoker/redbaron)
to automatically add a meetup from meetup.com to the source of events.

## [Afpyro-BE](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/afpyro-be)

Afpryro are python lover *apero* (aperitif) where we meet each others and
sometimes do talks. [Ludo](https://twitter.com/GMLudo) has launched the Belgium
version of them and I've had the pleasure to organise one edition (with [staz](http://staz.be)) and do a talk
(["Les outils de debug en python et
django"](http://psycojoker.github.io/slides-afpyro/#slide1)) at another one.

## [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org)'s [Python Devroom](https://www.python-fosdem.org/)

I've been helping for the organisation of the Python Devroom for the year 2014
and 2015.

FOSDEM is the biggest European freesoftware developers meeting. It happens
during the first weekend of February at the ULB at Brussels.

## [DierenTheater](http://dierentheater.be/)

DierenTheater is a tool that parses the Belgian federal Parliament (namely "la
Chambre" or "de Kamer"), extracts data from it and offers them to the world via
Rest API and database dumps. The hope is to see people reuse this data to build
wonderful tools for citizens use.

I've made this project in [django-nonrel](http://django-nonrel.org/) to be able
to use [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) as a database and I'm pretty happy
about it for this kind of usage.

## [NosÉlus.Be](http://noselus.be)

NosÉlus.Be is a new project, born at the [eGov Wallonia
Hackathon](http://hackathonegovwallonia.net/) (where I wasn't present), that
aims to give a better vision to citizens of what their MPs are doing. The current
focus is written questions. They have used my data from DierenTheater.

I've recently went to a meeting with the initiator of that project and other
people and I hope that we can build something beautiful together.

## [Regards Citoyens](http://www.regardscitoyens.org/) ([nosdéputés.fr](http://www.nosdeputes.fr/) and [nossénateurs.fr](http://www.nossenateurs.fr/))

Regards Citoyens is a French initiative that aim to simplify the process of our
democratic institutions. One of its most know action is the website
[nosdéputés.fr](http://www.nosdeputes.fr/) but it's only a part of what is being
done.

I'm not that much involved in it, only giving small tip from time to time, but
I really love what they are doing so I put them here to give them some
advertisement.

## Other
<div style="text-align: left;">

<ul>
<li><a href="https://hackerspace.be/welcome/index.html">HSBXL</a> is the oldest Hackerspace of Brussels where I go from time to time since they are doing cool things. I'm also an official member of it now (but I don't do that much things there.)</li>

## [Political Memory](http://memopol.org)

I used to be the main developer of the Political Memory. It is a tool whose purpose is
to allow a NGOs (or anyone in fact) to publish the voting recommendation they
have sent to elected representatives, the tool then gathers the list of elected
representatives, their votes and generates a listing of how well those elected
representatives have been following those voting recommendations. Example: [la
Quadrature du Net](https://laquadrature.net) told the Members of the European
Parliament that they should vote against
[ACTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Counterfeiting_Trade_Agreement)
because it is destroying our freedom of the Internet (and for many other
reasons) and [here you can get the
result](https://memopol.lqdn.fr/europe/parliament/vote/acta_final/) (no, I'm
not happy by the current display).

The whole point of this tool is that if you think, for example, that la
Quadrature du Net represents you interests on Internet related subjects, you can
go of the Political Memory of la Quadrature du Net and see how well your
elected representatives are effectively representing you. This is a very
valuable information that you don't have for the moment, and that allows you to
see your representatives through concrete informations that are important for
you and that YOU have chosen, not through their marketing campaign or what the
press is saying about them.

Of course, the objective is a wider adoption of this tool by politically
involved NGOs or individuals. This is my current focus since, as of today, la
Quadrature du Net is the only one to use it.

It's a tool, initially made by [Gibus](http://pascontent.sedrati-dinet.net/)
for [la Quadrature du Net](https://laquadrature.net), of which I've been the
main dev of the second (and current) version with a lot of [awesome
contributors](https://github.com/Psycojoker/memopol2/blob/master/CREDITS.txt).
I'm currently focusing my effort in making this tool generic and usable by
humans with the idea of seeing a wider adoption of it.

### [Toutatis](http://toutatis.mm.staz.be/) and [Compotista](http://compotista.mm.staz.be/)

As part of the Political Memory new generic version, I've written 2 tools with
[staz](http://staz.be) to ease this work and extract things from the Political
Memory that shouldn't be in it.

Toutatis is a tool whose role is to make the matching between voting results
produced by the European Parliament, which only contain the last name of the
Member of the European Parliament, and a real member of the European Parliament.
I'm not going into detail about this problem here, but it's way harder than it seems.

Compotista is a tool to convert the Member of the European Parliament data
coming from [parltrack](http://parltrack.euwiki.org/) into the *representative
format* which we have written with [stf](http://www.ctrlc.hu/~stef/blog/).

## [La Quadrature du Net](https://laquadrature.net)

La Quadrature du Net is a citizen group that defend our Fundamental rights on
the Internet at the French and at the European level (and probably more). They
have been very active against
[ACTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Counterfeiting_Trade_Agreement) and
many other subjects and bad law projects.

I've been helping them for more than 3 years by working in the press review
team, writing script, irc bot, websites (the Political Memory, "Pas Peur
d'Hadopi" with mathieui, ...), making signature statistics for the written
declaration 12, finding people to help during the written declaration 12 and
many other.

## [Software Freedom Day 2013](https://hackerspace.be/Software_Freedom_Day_2013) at the [HSBXL](https://hackerspace.be/welcome/index.html)

Software Freedom Day is a worldwide event where local freesoftware enthusiast
are encouraged to make celebration events. Jurgen has been doing this at the
[HSBXL](https://hackerspace.be/welcome/index.html) for some years already. This
year, Sid and I joined our forces with Jurgen, and with the help of members of
the HSBXL, it ended up being a [very cool
event](https://hackerspace.be/Software_Freedom_Day_2013).

## [RMLL 2013](https://2013.rmll.info/en/index.html)

The RMLL (LSM for Libre Software Meeting in english) is an annual freesoftware
meeting that happens in France, Belgium and Switzerland. I've joined the team of
the 2013 edition the first time this project nearly failed due to the
resignation of one of the key members. My main contribution has been to manage
the meetings since we were organizing ourselves in a do-ocratie way.

I've also made two presentations in the, very cool, Hackerspace Room, one about
the Political Memory and one to relaunch Neutrinet with the help of
[Taziden](http://www.libre-parcours.net/) and
[Bouska](https://twitter.com/b0uska). I've also participated to a round table
organised by [Teymour](http://www.april.org/trombinoscope.php?membre=tmorlier)
for Regards Citoyens (or maybe April? Not that sure) called « *Quand le libre
se mêle de démocratie* ».

## [P402](https://hackerspace.be/welcome/index.html)

P402 is a student collaborative platform built for the ULB by a friend (he
usually doesn't like being quoted online) following [a
post](http://worlddomination.be/blog/2012/idee-dun-plateforme-dentre-aide-pour-edutiants.html)
(in french) on how this kind of platform could be.

I've also contributed a bit to the code.

## [Seeks](https://beniz.github.io/seeks/)

Seeks used to be, for me, our best chance to have a good alternative to google
search engine. The main idea was make a network that put people that do similar
research together and to share this knowledge in a DHT. Sadly, its main
contributor has stopped working on it and the source code in C++, written in a very
"scientific" style, makes it hard for anyone to take over the project.

I've written a good part of the search engine parsers used in it. I'm still
waiting (because of the lack of time for me to do it myself) for a successor
project to emerge. And no, [searx](https://github.com/asciimoo/searx) is not
its successor, it's only an anomysing meta-search engine.

## [WarGod](https://github.com/Psycojoker/wargod)

Not that much an important thing, but since I'm still using it almost every day
I'll put it here. WarGod is a very simple RSS reader that generate static html
pages and that allow me to write simple xpath query to grab the content of a
post.

## [Cercle Informatique de l'ULB](http://cerkinfo.be)

The Cercle Informatique de l'ULB is a student society in which I've been
involved for many years during my studies. I've been lesson delegate, vice
president, (lost at presidency) and propaganda delegate. I've spent many years
doing a lot of things there, including [painting some
walls](/blog/2010/oh-noes-internet-invades-my-frats-local.html) and serving
beers at the FOSDEM.

Related to the Cercle Informatique, I've been fux for 2 years then Grand Senior
for 2 years in it's guilde, the Guilde Gates (it's a student group that
organises [cantus](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantus)).

## [BES](http://www.besciences.be/)

The BES, Bureau des Étudiants en Science, is a student representation
organisation at the ULB. I was secretary in it for one year.
