title:  Redirections finally done
---
body:


Thanks to my good old friend procrastination, I was finally forced to do
something way more boring than configuring url redirections to avoid broken
urls from my older blog engine, hurray \o/

I'll check out the 404 from the logs from time to time to see if something is
missing.

On a side node, it's always a bit chilling to go through the list of 404 and to
see all the urls tried by scripts to crack random websites.
