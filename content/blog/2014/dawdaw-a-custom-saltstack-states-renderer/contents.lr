title:  Release of dawdaw, a custom saltstack states renderer for extremly lazy python devs
---
body:


I've just release [dawdaw](https://github.com/Psycojoker/dawdaw), a custom
[saltstack](http://saltstack.com) (a config management tool) states render for
extremely python devs like me.

Here is an extract of the README:

Introduction
============

Dawdaw is an experiment to make a [SaltStack](http://www.saltstack.com/) custom [renderer](http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/renderers/index.html) (the stuff that allows you to write your states in yaml/jinja2/mako/other) in an attempt to solve those problems:

* current states are extremely too verbose to write
* you often repeat yourself way too much
* really have a linear states declaration for requires
* explicit requires on included states, because global sucks
* namespacing all the things, because global sucks
* indirectly trying to solve the "salt states totally sucks are being redistributed" problem by going full python, you can now use setup.py and pypi/pip to redistribute you workÂ¹

Disadvantages: you move await from full declarative code (which you were
already doing in fact with jinja2 templates) to go back to python code. This
is, on one hand very powerful, on the other hand probably too powerful (and may
be way less easy to understand for devops that don't come from a programming
background). That works for me because I'm a python dev and I'm using this for
my personal usages, but that might not fit your case.

Sample
======

Move from:

{% H 'yaml' %}
include:
  - dotfiles

wyrd-pkgs:
  pkg.installed:
    - name: wyrd
    - require:
      - sls: dotfiles

reminds.git:
  git.latest:
    - name: ssh://git@bitbucket.org/psycojoker/reminds.git
    - runas: psycojoker
    - target: /home/psycojoker/reminds/
    - require:
      - pkg: git

cd /home/psycojoker/reminds/ && bash init:
  cmd.run:
    - unless: ls /home/psycojoker/.reminders /home/psycojoker/.reminders.gcl
    - user: psycojoker
    - require:
      - git: reminds.git
{% endH %}

To:

{% H 'python' %}
#!dawdaw_template

from dawdaw.states import pkg, git, cmd, include
from dawdaw.utils import default, test, debug

dotfiles = include("dotfiles")

with default(user="psycojoker", runas="psycojoker"):
    pkg.installed("wyrd",
                  require=[dotfiles.get("pkg", "dotfiles-pkgs")])
    git.latest("ssh://git@bitbucket.org/psycojoker/reminds.git",
               target="/home/psycojoker/reminds/")

    if not test("ls /home/psycojoker/.reminders /home/psycojoker/.reminders.gcl"):
        cmd.run("cd /home/psycojoker/reminds/ && bash init")
{% endH %}
