title:  ChangeLog mode
---
body:


Hello everyone,

Since blogging is, obviously, not an activity I really enjoy but since I have
still things that I do and things that it's pretty cool to share them, I'm
going to switch from "trying and failing to write so called blog post" to "this
blog is going to be a ChangeLog of what I've been doing" with a much simpler
writing style and a more "raw" style (not giving that much context to explain
everything).

Cheers,
