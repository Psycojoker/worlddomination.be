	<!-- Hyde::Article::Begin -->

<!-- Hyde::Excerpt::Begin -->

<p>I've made quite some significant updates to the
<a href="http://hackeragenda.be/">Hackeragenda</a> during the previous days, here is the
mail I've sent to the mailing list announcing the good&nbsp;news:</p>
<p><img src="/media/img/hackeragenda/update_may_2014.png" /></p>
<p>Ohai&nbsp;folks,</p>
<p>I haven't gave you any news since my first mail about the hacker
agenda, but that doesn't mean that nothing has&nbsp;changed!</p>
<p>Reminder of what hackeragenda is: it's a website that aggregate the
events in belgium interesting for hackers of the hackerspace
community. It does that by fetching data from other website (by
scraping most of the time ...) <em>instead</em> of asking users to submit
events on it. This is my modest attemp to answer the problem "everyone
is doing shitload of things and no one is aware of that and that&nbsp;sucks".</p>
<p>(tl;dr at the&nbsp;end)</p>
<p>First of all and starting with the oldest changes: the hackeragenda
now has a real domain name: http://hackeragenda.be easier to remember,
such&nbsp;wow</p>
<p>In the mean time, with the help of <a href="https://github.com/titouanc">Titou</a>
we've added some new sources, most of them are either hackerspaces,
hackerspaces-like, fablabs or numerical&nbsp;artists.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/olethanh">Staz</a> has worked on a json specification
of a format that an organisation can implement to ease our work to add
it to the hackeragenda. It's described in the FAQ. Said in another
way: if you give me an url that provide me with a json document that
follows the spec, I can add you very easily to the&nbsp;hackeragenda.</p>
<p>But the big news is that I've just coded the possibility of filtering
events by sources and by tags! The absence of that possiblity is one
of the reason of my absence of communication/advertissment: I didn't
wanted to be in a situation where I would have to answer to someone
"no, your stuff is not ~hacker[space]~ enough to be in it". Now I
don't care anymore, I just have to not list it in the events by
default. This also mean that you can do your own selection without
having me imposing my choices on you&nbsp;:)</p>
<p>To play with filtering click on "customize" or chose one of the
predefined filter next to it.
Filtering works this&nbsp;way:</p>
<ul>
<li>each source/tag has three state: active (colour), inactive (grey), excluding&nbsp;(sticked)</li>
<li>if all filters are inactive, everything is&nbsp;shown</li>
<li>if some filters are active, only those filters are&nbsp;shown</li>
<li>if some filters are excluding, those filters are not&nbsp;shown</li>
<li>those rules applies <em>per</em> type of filter (source or&nbsp;tag)</li>
<li>play a bit with it, you'll understand&nbsp;quickly</li>
<li>of course, filters modify the url to save your&nbsp;preferences</li>
</ul>
<p>This might not be the most intuitive interface, but this is quite
powerful are your are not the normal users&nbsp;:)</p>
<p>Also, this new filtering interface allows me to introduction sections \o/
I've put some&nbsp;already:</p>
<ul>
<li>[default](http://hackeragenda.be: this is what everyone is sawing by default, it's nearly the same that it was before: events from hackerspaces/fablabs/hackerspace-like/numeric artists/some stuff in the hackerspace community, the only modification is that now I don't show regular hackerspace meetings like techtuesday, techwednesday etc... to focus more on "more unique"&nbsp;events.</li>
<li><a href="https://hackeragenda.be/?section=all">all</a>: show&nbsp;everything</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://hackeragenda.be/?section=hackerspaces">hackerspaces</a>: show events from what I've identified as hackerspace (it's possible that some are&nbsp;missing)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>/!\ NEW /!\ <a href="http://hackeragenda.be/?section=code">Code</a>: events related to programming/database/agile that I've found on meetup.com, if you know others don't hesitate to send them to me by&nbsp;email</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have sections ideas (<em>with sources</em>) that can interest
hackers, don't hesitate to send them to me (or send patchs, the code
is simple). Same if you have sources (they must be parsable in a more
or less reliable&nbsp;state).</p>
<p>Also: I still refuse to add events by hand in the hackeragenda, I'm
extremely lazy and totally hate moderation, I only add new sources.
The hackeragenda must be able to work without anyone touching it for
months. However, if someone is willing to build a website where you
can submit events and that implement the hackeragenda API, I'll add
this source with pleasure to the hackeragenda and if it's in Django
I'm ready to contribute to it (but I don't want to do moderation) (I'm
thinking from time to time about coding this, but I'm not very
motivated and after I'll need to find responsible and motivated
moderators which takes time).
Ohai&nbsp;folks,</p>
<p>Code is available here: https://github.com/Psycojoker/hackeragenda if
you want to contribute :) It's python (django)/js(mostly jquery) for
the front end. The code is normally quite simple and&nbsp;clean.</p>
<p>tl;dr</p>
<ul>
<li>it has a real url now:&nbsp;http://hackeragenda.be/</li>
<li>new sources added (mostly hackerspaces and numeric artists&nbsp;stuff)</li>
<li>a json format has been defined, so if you implement it it's very easy for me to add your organisation to the hackeragenda, see the&nbsp;FAQ</li>
<li>new filtering engine, this allows me to put more stuff without overloading the default&nbsp;view</li>
<li>filters also apply on rss and&nbsp;ical</li>
<li>therefor a new section "Code" with a lot of sources of events that I've found on meetup.com, send me the one I'm missing!&nbsp;http://hackeragenda.be/?section=code</li>
<li>also the default view don't show regular meetings (like techtuesday, techwednesday ...) anymore to focus more on "unique&nbsp;events"</li>
<li>I still refuse to add events by hand because I'm lazy and hate&nbsp;moderation</li>
<li>if you have sections ideas (<em>with sources</em>) that can interest hackers, send them to me (or send patchs, the code is&nbsp;simple)</li>
<li>code is (still) here if you want to contribute&nbsp;https://github.com/Psycojoker/hackeragenda</li>
</ul>
<p>But, most importantly, I'm doing this to solve the problem "everyone
is doing shitload of things and no one is aware of that and that
sucks" and to solve it efficiently, well, people need, at least, to
know that the hackeragenda exists (and I suck at advertisement), so it
would be very kind of you if you could spread the word of its
existence around you :) Thanks in&nbsp;advance!</p>
<p>That's all&nbsp;folks!</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>&lt;3</p>
